        Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define
        paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five
        sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the
        unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a
        paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single
        sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and
        appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph.
        For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic
        styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a
        paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main
        idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,”
        because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.

        Since the commercialization of the Web, Web development has been a
        growing industry. The growth of this industry is being driven by
        businesses wishing to use their Web site to advertise and sell products
        and services to customers.[3] There are many open source tools for Web
        development such as BerkeleyDB, GlassFish, LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL,
        PHP) stack and Perl/Plack. This has kept the cost of learning Web
        development to a minimum. Another contributing factor to the growth of
        the industry has been the rise of easy-to-use WYSIWYG Web-development
        software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Microsoft Visual
        Studio. Knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or of programming
        languages is still required to use such software, but the basics can be
        learned and implemented quickly. An ever-growing set of tools and
        technologies have helped developers build more dynamic and interactive
        Web sites. Further, Web developers now help to deliver applications as
        Web services which were traditionally only available as applications on
        a desk-based computer. This has allowed for many opportunities to
        decentralize information and media distribution. Examples can be seen
        with the rise of cloud services such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox
        and Google Drive. These Web services allow users to interact with
        applications from many locations, instead of being tied to a specific
        workstation for their application environment. Examples of dramatic
        transformation in communication and commerce led by Web development
        include e-commerce. Online auction sites such as eBay have changed the
        way consumers find and purchase goods and services. Online retailers
        such as Amazon.com and Buy.com (among many others) have transformed the
        shopping and bargain-hunting experience for many consumers. Another
        example of transformative communication led by Web development is the
        blog. Web applications such as WordPress and Movable Type have created
        blog-environments for individual Web sites. The increased usage of
        open-source content management systems and enterprise content management
        systems has extended Web development's impact at online interaction and
        communication. Web development has also impacted personal networking and
        marketing. Web sites are no longer simply tools for work or for
        commerce, but serve more broadly for communication and social
        networking. Web sites such as Facebook and Twitter provide users with a
        platform to communicate and organizations with a more personal and
        interactive way to engage the public. The increased usage of open-source

        Security considerations Web development takes into account many security
        considerations, such as data entry error checking through forms,
        filtering output, and encryption. Malicious practices such as SQL
        injection can be executed by users with ill intent yet with only
        primitive knowledge of Web development as a whole. Scripts can be used
        to exploit Web sites by granting unauthorized access to malicious users
        that try to collect information such as email addresses, passwords and
        protected content like credit card numbers. Some of this is dependent on
        the server environment on which the scripting language, such as ASP,
        JSP, PHP, Python, Perl or Ruby is running, and therefore is not
        necessarily down to the Web developer themselves to maintain. However,
        stringent testing of Web applications before public release is
        encouraged to prevent such exploits from occurring. If some contact form
        is provided on a Web site it should include a captcha field in it which
        prevents computer programs from automatically filling forms and also
        mail spamming. Because new security holes are found in Web applications
        even after testing and launch, security patch updates are frequent for
        widely used applications. It is often the job of Web developers to keep
        applications up to date as security patches are released and new
        security concerns are discovered. Keeping a Web server safe from
        intrusion is often called Server Port Hardening. Many technologies come
        into play to keep information on the Internet safe when it is
        transmitted from one location to another. For instance TLS certificates
        (or "SSL certificates") are issued by certificate authorities to help
        prevent Internet fraud. Many developers often employ different forms of
        encryption when transmitting and storing sensitive information. A basic
        understanding of information technology security concerns is often part
        of a Web developer's knowledge.{" "}
